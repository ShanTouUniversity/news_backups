# 汕头大学医学院附一院导师被指学术失范 研究生控诉成果遭窃取
**日期：2024年6月7日**

某研究生通过公众号发文控诉其导师（汕头大学医学院附一院消化科蔡姓导师）存在学术不端及管理失当行为，主要指控如下：

1. **课题承诺未兑现**
   - 入学前协商研究方向为"消化道早期癌与菌群"，入学后被强行更改为"脂肪肝与菌群"。
   - 导师长期拒绝为当事人办理执业资格转院手续，导致其无法参与临床工作。

2. **科研操作遭质疑**
   - 实验设计缺陷：对照组缺失（仅设6组对应超3个干预因素）、样本留取不规范；
   - 导师对试剂/动物实验资源申请保持沉默，日常仅以"转发公众号内容"作为指导；
   - 学术造假嫌疑：申请药物未遵循指南共识、动物实验结果评估不完整（未做肝纤维化检测）。

3. **学术成果疑遭剽窃**
   - 当事人2024年8月汇报的首批小鼠实验（含完整肝纤维化评估及药物对照组）PPT被导师取走；
   - 2025年5月发现同课题组马姓学生答辩课题与己方实验高度雷同，但该生：
     ✓ 原有课题方向完全不同（Chrebp基因研究）；
     ✓ 2024年10月处死所有实验小鼠，却能在半年内"重构"脂肪肝模型完成毕业。
   - 学术委员会认定"无学术不端"，研究生科暗示控诉者存在心理问题。

4. **职业能力受争议**
   - 导师被指缺乏基础内镜技能（如分辨胃体胃窦），主攻的粪菌移植项目遭质疑临床规范性；
   - 曝出导师自述"能忽悠体检中心患者参与试验"，被质疑临床伦理失守。

文末呼吁科研界谨慎合作、患者谨慎就医。该文获逾50条读者留言支持，多数认可控诉者长期学术严谨性。

# Supervisor at Shantou University Medical College First Affiliated Hospital Accused of Academic Misconduct; Postgraduate Alleges Research Theft
**Date: June 7, 2024**

A postgraduate student has publicly accused their supervisor (a supervisor surnamed Cai in the Department of Gastroenterology, First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College) of academic misconduct and improper management in an article published on a WeChat official account. The key allegations are as follows:

1.  **Unfulfilled Research Commitments**
    -   The originally agreed research direction before admission, "Early Gastrointestinal Cancer and Microbiota," was forcibly changed to "Fatty Liver and Microbiota" after enrollment.
    -   The supervisor consistently refused to process the transfer of the student's professional practice qualification, preventing their participation in clinical work.

2.  **Questionable Research Practices**
    -   Flawed experimental design: Lack of appropriate control groups (only 6 groups for over 3 intervention factors) and non-standardized sample collection.
    -   Supervisor remained unresponsive to requests for reagents/animal experiment resources; daily "guidance" consisted merely of forwarding WeChat public account content.
    -   Suspected academic fraud: Failed to follow guidelines/consensus when applying drugs; incomplete evaluation of animal experiment results (liver fibrosis tests omitted).

3.  **Suspected Plagiarism of Academic Work**
    -   The student's August 2024 presentation PPT detailing the first batch of mouse experiments (including complete liver fibrosis assessment and drug control groups) was taken by the supervisor.
    -   In May 2025, discovered that the thesis defense topic of Ma, a student in the same research group, was highly identical to their own experiments. However:
        ✓   Ma's original research direction was completely different (Chrebp gene research).
        ✓   Ma euthanized all experimental mice in October 2024 but allegedly "reconstructed" the fatty liver model within six months to complete graduation.
    -   The academic committee ruled "no academic misconduct"; the postgraduate department insinuated the complainant had psychological issues.

4.  **Contested Professional Competence**
    -   Supervisor accused of lacking basic endoscopic skills (e.g., distinguishing gastric body from antrum), and their primary fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) project is questioned for clinical non-compliance.
    -   Revealed supervisor's self-described practice of "persuading physical examination center patients to participate in trials through misleading means," raising ethical concerns.

The article concludes by urging the research community to approach collaborations cautiously and advising patients to exercise caution when seeking medical care. It garnered over 50 supporting reader comments, mostly recognizing the complainant's longstanding academic rigor.
